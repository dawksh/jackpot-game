                    The prize pool grows from three sources:

                <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                    <li>$200 worth of $JACKPOT tokens added each time the jackpot resets.</li>

                    <li>Sell fees from $JACKPOT token transactions.</li>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    17.5% of every deposit is allocated to an operational reserve to help sustain game development and ongoing prize pool funding.

                <p>
                    Payouts are executed directly via the smart contract upon a winning spin. Players will need to manually claim their winnings from the game interface.
